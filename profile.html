        <p class="no-first-of">I’m Alex, a digital designer from St Albans, currently living and studying in Southampton. Since starting on the web in 2010, I’ve worked with dozens of clients as well as working at both digital and advertising orientated agencies. Although much of my experience has been as a front-end developer, I also have experience with back-end technologies and basic server integration. I have developed medium scale applications in Laravel, running on VPS instances spun up through the command line.</p>
