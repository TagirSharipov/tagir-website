# Hi there!
This is the as-of-yet unpublished source code of my personal site.

## Core technologies
  - Jekyll
  - Grunt (Dropped in favour of ruby based tasks) - Easier for hook deployment

## To-do list
  - CDN integration
  - Social meta tags (Twitter Cards, Open Graph)
  - General speed optimisation
  - Setup nginx redirects (server only)
  - Image optimisation (JPEGMini vs Grunt)
