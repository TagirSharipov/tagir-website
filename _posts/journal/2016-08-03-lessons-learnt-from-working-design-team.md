Originally I wrote this post for anyone who's about to or has just started working in a creative role. But further to that, I always find it interesting learning about how design teams function in other companies. So here's a few rambled ideas and insights in to how our team works at Pusher.

## The Structure

At Pusher, the design team (or creative team) consists of myself, a front-end engineer, [Lauren](https://twitter.com/laurenmplews) our lead designer. Historically we came under marketing, however a few months back we divided off in to what we know refer to as a 'service team'. The idea is that we're not tied to anyone area of the company, and can float between different teams to assist with design/implementation based projects.

Whether that be [redesigning our dashboard](/project/pusher-dashboard/) with the product team, working with the Sales team creating docs, or creating marketing assets with..er..marketing.

## Learning how to give feedback

This is something that I was hesitant to put in, as it's something that's totally personal.

There are a million and one methodologies and proccesses that you can use to give feedback. But it all boils down to two points:
1, is your feedback actually going to help?
And 2, don't be a dick. 
I think sometimes having a smaller team can make taking and giving feedback harder. It's all too easy to get in to the headspace of wanting

## Staying relevant

This isn't just a case of staying up to date with trends, but it's about staying up to date with opinions and thoughts.

Everyone has an opinion on design. But it's learning how to put it aside and work it in to your process which is the hard thing.

Even though we pretty much sit next to each other, as a team it's really important that we share our opinions and have some sort of discussion.

Something that our lead designer Lauren came up with, is to have a weekly 'Inspire, Create, Debate' session. We set aside 20-to-30 minutes on a Friday afternoon, and take it in turns to choose a topic to discuss. It could be a new trend, a cool site that we've sent, or just a topic. These are a few past ones:

* Debate Topic: Should designers lead companies?
* Inspire: Bloomberg and brutalisim
* Debate Topic: Where does design end?

## Process is everything

Working in a team is hard. Whether it being managing expectations or working within someone elses timeframe, actually getting work done can sometimes be hard.

Our process if far from refined. In fact we deviate from it on pretty much every project that we work on. And I don't think that's a bad thing. 

## Speak up. Don't be afraid to put your ideas forward
