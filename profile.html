    <p>I'm Alex, a front-end engineer in London, currently working at Pusher. Since starting on the web in 2010 as a freelancer, I've worked with various clients from a range of industries such as music and education. I also have experience in both more traditional advertising and digital agencies.</p>

  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-6 grid__columns">
    <p>Although much of my experience has been with the front-end, I also work closely with many back-end technologies including Ruby and PHP. I can complete a project through from the initial designs, right in to implementation.
