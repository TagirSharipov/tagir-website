    <h2>The Brief</h2>
    <p>I was approached in late 2014 to create the new visuals for the user-facing side of morethanabusinesscard.com. The pre-exsiting branding was to be used, however as the sole designer, I had full reign over direction.</p>

    <h2>What the client thought</h2>
    <p>Backed with hours of market and user research, I presented a modern, responsive site. From a development standpoint, my approach was to build the site as a series of components. This would allow the client to construct new templates (although some coding knowledge would be required) from the component library.</p>
    <p>Further more, I took the oppurtunity to make use of a usability lab that I had access to, in order to test the site with real users. Although generally succesful, these tests provided several points where im could be made.</p>
