## The Project

Besides raw code, the dashboard is the main point of interaction that customers have with Pusher. As the company has grown, new features have been added, however these addtions have been at the cost of the overall user experience and aesthetic.

A subteam consisting of myself, [Hamilton](https://twitter.com/hamchapman) (the project owner), and [Lauren](https://twitter.com/laurenmplews) (our lead designer), we set about planning how our new dashboard should work.

## Simple from the off
The dashboard works great when it's filled with information, but what's the experience like if you've just started? We wanted to encourage a sense of exploration for new users, and so developed the onboarding wizard. With configurable options such as cluster, name, and inviting collaborators.

## Launching publically
After some testing with a small set of beta users, we finally launched our new dashboard into the wild. Through tools such as FullStory, we quickly identified areas where users were stuggling, and quickly rolled out fixes.
