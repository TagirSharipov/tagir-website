    <h2>The Brief</h2>
    <p>Int Marine, an international yacht chartering company approached my University looking for students to help create a new website. There were very little constraintss in terms of aesthetic, with the client only requesting that the site be responsive and backwards compatible to IE9.</p>

    <h2>What I did</h2>
    <p>Backed with hours of market and user research, I presented a modern, responsive site. From a development standpoint, my approach was to build the site as a series of components. This would allow the client to construct new templates (although some coding knowledge would be required) from the component library.</p>

    <p>Further more, I took the oppurtunity to make use of a usability lab that I had access to, in order to test the site with real users. Although generally succesful, these tests provided several points where improvements could be made.</p>
