        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The Panasonic global site aims to serve two key strands of user: Consumers looking to research and purchase products; and enterprise users requiring information about the company. In attempting to serve both of these, the current actually fails at both.</p>
    <p>Visually, the current site is outdated and uninspiring.</p>

        <h2>The Task</h2>
    <p>Explore ways to cater for both consumer and enterprise level users, and how users on mobile devices can be better served content.</p>

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <p>Created a responsive set of templates demonstrating what the site could look like. Time was spent considering both user requirements in terms of devices, as well as location.</p>

    <h2>A Global Navigation</h2>
    <p>The Panasonic site is comprised largely of several mini-sites geared towards promoting individual products. It was important to design an unbiased navigation system that would both look aesthetically pleasing and also be functional.</p>
    <p>Inspired largely by the BBC Orb navigation, I designed a clean navigation bar that can either be static at the top of the page, or float slightly below.</p>

    <h2>Developing for scale</h2>
    <p>Although the project scope was for an undergraduate degree project, I tried to approach it as if it were to be deployed live. This meant making development decisions that would allow for rapid scale  .</p>

    <p>This project was undertaken as part of my final-year project. After being nominated for the WRTI innovation and technology awards, I was awarded first place for the project.</p>
