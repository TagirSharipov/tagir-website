    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>The Panasonic global site aims to serve two key strands of user: Consumers looking to research and purchase products; and enterprise users requiring information about the company. In attempting to serve both of these, the current actually fails at both.</p>
    <p>Visually, the current site is outdated and uninspiring.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Task</h2>
    <p>Explore ways how to inspire at consumer level, targeting the maximum number of users with the overall aim of creating a concept website.</p>

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <p>Created a responsive set of templates demonstrating what the site could look like. Time was spent considering both user requirements in terms of devices, as well as location.</p>
