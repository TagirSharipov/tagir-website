Since finishing my degree in May, I've finally had some time to put some much needed effort in to my personal site. I thought it might be useful just to have a quick rundown of the technologies behind it.

## CMS

Jekyll is at the core of the site. As someone who uses PHP frameworks daily, I was a little sceptical at first about using a static site generator, but I'm definetely starting to see the benefits in terms of performance.

## Fonts

Served from TypeKit, Headers are set in Kepler Std Display, Copy in Lora, and sub-headers in FF Good Headline Pro.

## Taskrunners?

Due to the set-up of my deployment method (commit to GitHub, send a post hook to server), I decieded to drop Grunt from my workflow, and instead opt for Jekyll's built in tools.
