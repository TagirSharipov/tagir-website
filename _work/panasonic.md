        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The Panasonic global site is the landing page for the core brand. It aims to serve both consumer (looking to research and purchase products), and enterprise level users (looking for information about the company). However, the site actually fails to serve either of these strands effectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-columns__col">
        <h2>The Task</h2>
        <p>Explore ways to cater for both consumer and enterprise level users, and how users on mobile devices can be better served content. This should be presented in a folio of research, and an interactive prototype.</p>
    </div>

<div class="page__article--inner">
    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <p>Created a responsive set of templates demonstrating what the site could look like. Time was spent considering both user requirements in terms of devices, as well as location.</p>

    <h2>A Global Navigation</h2>
    <p>The Panasonic site is comprised largely of several mini-sites geared towards promoting individual products. It was important to design an unbiased navigation system that would both look aesthetically pleasing and also be functional in any context.</p>
    <p>Inspired largely by the BBC Orb navigation, I designed a clean navigation bar that can either be static at the top of the page, or float slightly below.</p>

    <h2>Developing for scale</h2>
    <p>Although the project scope was for an undergraduate degree project, I tried to approach it as if it were to be deployed live. This meant making adopting development techniques and technologies that would cater for scale and the need for security.</p>
    <p>For example, the Laravel framework was chosen for its robustness and modular design.</p>

    <p>This project was undertaken as part of my final-year project. After being nominated for the WRTI innovation and technology awards, I was <a href="http://official.blog.solent.ac.uk/press-releases/bridging-the-innovation-gap-from-necessity-to-invention/">awarded first place</a> for the project.</p>
